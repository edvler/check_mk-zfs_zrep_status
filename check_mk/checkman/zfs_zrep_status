title: Plugin to check the status of the ZREP tool for ZFS dataset synchronisation
agents: linux
author: Matthias Maderer <edvler@edvler-blog.de>
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check runs on distributions which support the ZFS filesystem
 and has the ZREP tool installed.

 It querys the status with zrep status and parses the output.
 For each ZREP intialized ZFS dataset is one service created.

 The default is that the service gets {critical} if the synchronisation is
 older than 30 hours. It gets {warning} if the synchronisation is older than 26 hours.
 
 The {critical} and {warning} limits can be configured in WATO.
 The check can also be disabled for a ZFS dataset.
 Goto WATO - Host & Service Parameters. Search for zrep.

 The check needs a ZREP intialzied ZFS dataset.
 To initialize a ZFS dataset with ZREP please go to:
 http://www.bolthole.com/solaris/zrep/

 Newly synchronized ZFS datasets are displayed as new service by the check_mk
 inventory check.
